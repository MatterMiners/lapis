summary: "Proper termination of simulation"
description: |
  The simulation so far only awaited that the job queue became empty. This however
  did not ensure that the jobs also properly finished. Therefore, the scheduler
  now has a new property to store the number of running jobs. So the termination
  of the scheduler is now additionally bound to this counter getting ``0``.
